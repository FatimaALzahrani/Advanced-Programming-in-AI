## **Exercise 3**

**Question:** What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
**Answer:**

| **Aspect**     | **Compiler**                                                        | **Interpreter**                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Converts the entire source code into machine code before execution. | Translates and executes the code line by line.           |
| **Execution**  | The program is executed after the compilation is complete.          | Executes the code immediately, line by line.             |
| **Speed**      | Faster execution after compilation.                                 | Slower due to line-by-line execution.                    |
| **Output**     | Creates a separate executable file.                                 | No separate executable file; execution happens directly. |
| **Examples**   | C, C++                                                              | Python, JavaScript                                       |

<hr/>

## **Exercise 7**

**Question:** What will the following program print out:
x = 43
x = x- 1
print(x)
a) 43
b) 42
c) x + 1
d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically
**Answer:**  
 **b) 42**

<hr/>

## **Exercise 8**

**Question:** Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:
(1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input
Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, ‚ÄúWhat is the human equivalent to a
Central Processing Unit‚Äù?

**Answer:**

- CPU (Central Processing Unit) üß†: Like the brain, it processes information and calculations.
- RAM (Main Memory) üìù: Like short-term memory, it temporarily stores information while working.
- Secondary Memory üì¶: Like long-term memory, it keeps things like photos and files safe for the future.
- Input Device üëÄüé§: Like senses (eyes, ears), it brings information into the system.
- Output Device üñ•Ô∏èüîä: Like the mouth or hands, it delivers results or actions.
